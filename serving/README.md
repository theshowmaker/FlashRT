# serving/ — scenario hosts on the FlashRT execution contract

The **serving layer**: native hosts that drive the execution contract
(`libflashrt_exec`, see `docs/exec_contract.md`) for a concrete scenario. This
is the **scenario / policy** layer — sessions, schedulers, protocols, sensor
loops, interrupt policy live here, deliberately *out of* the contract.

FlashRT layering:
```
flash_rt/  (Python frontend)   setup: weights, calibration, autotune, capture, adopt  [cold]
serving/   (this dir)          hosts: drive replay / Plan, define the scenario          [hot path]
exec/      (C ABI contract)    replay-time mechanism: Buffer / Graph / Plan             [hot path]
csrc/      (kernels)           the captured compute (fvk / cutlass / ...)               [hot path]
```

All hosts link the same `libflashrt_exec`; host language is chosen per scenario.

**Runnable Python hosts** (verified end-to-end with real Pi05 — the community can
play with the mechanism directly):
- **`robot_recap/`** — π*0.6/RECAP RL rollout: advantage-conditioned policy
  (`set_rl_mode` CFG) + value-function critic co-hosted via ONE exec ctx, with an
  episode state machine (per-chunk interruptible, buffer reset). Solves the real
  "can't stop inference between episodes to reset/record" problem.
- **`robot_pi07/`** — π0.7 hierarchy (BAGEL dropped): planner → subtask shared
  buffer → actor, multi-rate, mid-run subtask interrupt. Two Pi05 via ONE ctx.

**Native deployment host examples** (skeletons — how to write the production host):
- **`robot_host/`** (C++) — real-time VLA host pattern: Plan, concurrent stream,
  buffer-overwrite interrupt. C++ = one toolchain with exec+kernel, no FFI seam,
  real-time/ROS2-adjacent.
- **`llm_agent/`** (Rust) — LLM session server: per-token replay over the C ABI.
  Rust = async/safety shell; the FFI seam is crossed once per token.

Setup (capture + adopt) builds the handles once — via the Python frontend in the
same process (Python out of the hot loop), or ported to native for a no-Python
build. A captured CUDA graph is not serializable across processes, so capture
runs in the same process that replays.

The two Python hosts are mechanism demos: they drive real Pi05 graphs through the
contract (multi-model co-host, hand-off, interrupt, reset) and verify the
hot-path; they reuse the captured chunk and use stand-in critic/subtask wiring
(see each README for honest scope). The C++/Rust dirs are reference skeletons.
